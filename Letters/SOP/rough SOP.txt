ANS - 

During my undergraduate studies in BSc Computer Science at Savitribai Phule University, I developed a strong foundation in programming languages and database subjects, as these were my areas of interest. I have always wanted to develop applications, which fueled my enthusiasm for software development. My interest in logic building and programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and SQL peaked during this time. 

Alongside my academic pursuits, I also played football for my local city club. This commitment allowed me to maintain a respectable score in my degree program. In my final year, I worked on a project to develop a user management system, where my primary contributions focused on the database and backend aspects. The project aimed to manage user profiles and transactional data, making it applicable across various fields. Additionally, I attended a seminar on cloud computing during my final year, which significantly expanded my interest in data.

I then applied for an MSc in Data Science at Fergusson College under Savitribai Phule University. As this course was newly introduced, we were part of the second batch. The curriculum was not thoroughly structured and largely focused on data analytics, BI tools, and basic concepts of data engineering, providing hands-on practice in those areas. Unfortunately, some of the teachers lacked experience in the data science field, which affected the quality of instruction.

Throughout the program, I took courses in basic and advanced statistics, Python and R programming, mathematics, machine learning, and deep learning. However, the topics related to AI were not at the level required, and they were not taught by experienced lecturers or industry experts. During my third semester, I worked on various sub-projects and case studies, including a machine learning project focused on price prediction and classification for apartments, as well as a deep learning project for sound classification.

The fourth semester was dedicated to my internship and final project. I secured an internship at Ellicium Solutions, a data-driven company, where I received training from professionals in data engineering, BI tools, data warehousing, and data analytics. I worked on a live client project based on a proof of concept (POC), where I developed multiple algorithms using Python, including web scrapers, data transformation tools, analytical models and also collaborated with data scientists to prepare and extract datasets from various sources. As this was my final year project which was focused on supply chain risk analytics.

My experience in the industry has deepened my understanding of what it takes to be a data scientist and AI specialist. Working closely with data and gaining domain knowledge has only increased my interest in this field. I am eager to explore the tremendous solutions that can be built using AI in the supply chain industry and many other domains.



Human ----

During my undergraduate studies in BSc Computer Science at Savitribai Phule University, I have developed a good solid foundation in programming languages and database topics, as these were my areas of interest. I had great zeal to apply the applications I was required to make, where my interest in software development was ignited. I became more interested in logic building and programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and SQL, during this time. 

Along with all my academic pursuits, I also played football for my local city club. This enabled me to maintain a respectable score for my degree program. In my last year, I was involved in a project to design a user management system, where my contributions basically involved the database and backend front ends. This project was aimed at managing user profiles and transactional data, which can be applied to numerous fields. Additionally, I attended a seminar on cloud computing in my final year, which greatly enhanced my interest in data. 

I subsequently applied to the Master's in Data Science program at Fergusson College under Savitribai Phule University. Our group was the second cohort through the newly introduced curriculum. This specific curriculum was not rigidly structured; it mainly hinged on data analytics, BI tools, and elementary data engineering concepts, with practical work therein as the most appreciable thing. Some of the professors, sadly, were not experienced in the data science field, which detracted from the quality of the course.

I studied basic and advanced statistics, Python and R programming, math, machine learning, and deep learning during the course. However, AI concepts were not pitched as required, while often the teachers were not practitioners or experts from the industry. While working on various sub-projects and case studies in our third semester, I executed a machine-learning project on price prediction and classification of apartments and a deep learning project on sound classification.

The fourth semester was dedicated to my internship and culminating project. Having secured an internship at Ellicium Solutions, a data-driven company, I underwent training from industry professionals in data engineering, BI tools, data warehousing, and data analytics. Working on a live client project based on proof of concept (POC), I developed several algorithms using Python, including web scrapers, data transformation tools, and analytical models and collaborated with data scientists on dataset preparation and extraction from various sources. This was the project for my final year, and it focused on supply chain risk analytics. 

My experience in the industry deepened my understanding of what it would take to be a data scientist and duly qualify as an AI specialist. Working closely with data and gaining experience in the respective domain only heightened my passion for the sector. I am delighted to brainstorm the immense possibilities that can be created by leveraging AI within the supply chain industry and several more domains.
